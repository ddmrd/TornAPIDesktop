# TornAPIDesktop

#Usage
This app at the start will need your api key. You can go to the settings and enter this then click save. In order for the save function to work you need to put the executable into a file you can read from and write to.




This is a desktop application that uses your Torn API key to fetch information about your account and updates it periodically to keep you up to date. The plan is to add useful features.
